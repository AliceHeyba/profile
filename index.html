  <p>Hello, Bonjour, Guten Tag, Hola and 你好. I'm Alice and I'm looking for a Junior Software Engineer job!</p>
  <p> I've spent the past 14 years doing Business Development in the e-commerce and online travel sectors in both Corporate and start-up environments. I was in charge of opening the <a href="https://www.agoda.com/">Agoda (Booking.com group) </a> offices in Berlin and Barcelona and got to put together dream teams in both cities. I loved seeing my markets and teams grow and more recently was put in charge of heading up the Connectivity Department at <a href="https://impala.travel/">Impala</a>, a hospitality tech start-up. I loved (nearly :-) ) every minute of the this journey that brought me to live in Berlin, Hong Kong, New York, Barcelona and now London. It's time for a change and  I decided to retrain and become a Software Engineer by joining the <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course">Le Wagon</a> Intensive Web Development in October 2022.

    <h3>Alice 4.0 - Future me</h3>
    <p>I am looking to work as a Junior Software Engineer in London in a large company where I can learn from my colleagues - I'm pretty flexible on the sector. I would love, love, love to work for Bumble, connecting people, or in a company that has a positive influence on climate change. </p>

    <h3>Alice 3.0 - Retraining</h3>
    <p>It's been a big decision to retrain and change my course of work by 180 degrees but I feel this will be one of the best decisions I took in my life!</p>

    <h3>Alice 2.0 - Global Nomad in online travel</h3>
    <p>I got into online travel soon after uni and joined <a href="https://www.splendia.com/">Splendia.com </a> in Barcelona. I was hooked on the sector and was promoted to oversee the APAC sales team a few years later, which meant I got to move to Hong Kong and got to travel tons in Asia and Australia - what else would you want as a 20-something?!</p>
    <p>A few years later I joined Agoda.com and with them got to move back to Europe. Initially I managed the German speaking team and markets and later the Iberia region. The learning curve on the job was huge as I was put in charge to open offices in both countries and be the project manager for everything from creating a legal entity in the country, to finding an office, hiring a team and training them up. I'm really proud of what the team there has achieved and how Germany has become a key source of revenue for Agoda Europe.</p>

    <h3>Alice 1.0 - Mini-me</h3>
    <p>I grew up in Germany to a German dad and French mother - 3 year old me was convinced that in this world all women speak French and all men speak German.</p>
    <p>I got the travel bug early on and at age 16 decided to go to the US to do a year of high school all by myself [insert Celine Dion song here]. After graduating I went to Switzerland to get my bachelor of science in hospitality management.</p>
